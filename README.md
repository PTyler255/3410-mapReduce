# 3410-mapReduce
Part 2 + test code is in a previous iteration if you want to test that
The mp4 has a screen recording of me verbally walking through and explaining the code
as I've been unable to test due to issues with Go Packaging. And also being away
from the computer lab so I can't tesk on multiple machines
If given the chance, I will also add mutex because I completely forgotten about
that!

If you want working Part 2 code, it is under the commit message of "Part 2" on April 28
